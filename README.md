# [GitLife](http://gitlife.mrmikea.com)

Turns your [GitHub contributions
calendar](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions) into a
simulation of [Conway's Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

## Feedback

<hello@mrmikea.com>

## Contributing

Unfortunately, I will not be accepting pull requests, as I would like to keep this a personal project. The best ways to contribute are by sending me an email (see above) and opening issues.

## TODO

- Slider for speed control
- Detect when the simulation stops producing unique frames
- Bring back the leaderboard
