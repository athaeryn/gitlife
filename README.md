Essentially I want to start a simulation of Conway's Game of Life inside the
Github contributions calendar of a given user. I think that would be awesome.

I want to make a little website where people can type in the name of a user,
and then watch the simulation, and interact with it in various ways.

I'm still working through the details on how I'm going to achieve this...
