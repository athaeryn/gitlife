# Uh oh!

I revisited this project recently planning to bring it back online, but discovered that GitHub removed the endpoint I was using to get the calendar data. I'm currently working on a different way to get the data over in the `node` branch.


GitLife turns your [GitHub contributions calendar](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions) into a
simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
